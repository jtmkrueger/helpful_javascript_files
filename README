This is a collection of javascript files that I use frequently and almost always add to new projects.  The included files are:

1.)css_browser_selector.js
  -this is great for making rules like:
    .ie7 #form_box
  -very useful!
  
2.)input-placeholder-text.js
  -only webkit browsers allow placeholder text for form elements.  This turns it into a javascript method.
  -include the classes shown at the top of the javascript file!
  
3.)my_functions.js
  -These are functions that I have written to do specific things I reuse:
    +if there is no .getElementsByClassName, create the function(pull it together ie!)
    
4.)onDOMReady
  -now all browsers can take care of the onDOMReady function. Very helpful when noLoad isn't the right solution.
    
Thanks to the people who make some of these great javascripts!
